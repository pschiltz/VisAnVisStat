# SAS Software Installation Roadmap  

Welcome!  We are happy you have chosen **SAS Software**.  This guide will walk you through the entire process of installation and configuration of SAS Visual Analytics, SAS Visual Statistics, SAS/Stat, and Enterprise Guide.  These steps are derived from the [Office Analytics 2-Machine Installation Manual](https://go.documentation.sas.com/api/docsets/oatmig/7.4/content/oatmig.pdf).  The document is for a slightly different offering but the general steps are relevant.
